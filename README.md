# Data-Storage-and-Analysis-with-Microsoft-SQL-Server-SSIS-SSRS-and-Tableau-A-Sales-Data-Case-Study

Description: This project provides a comprehensive overview of data storage techniques, ETL processes using Microsoft SQL Server, and the extraction of insights from collected data. The project utilizes various tools, including Microsoft SQL Server, Visual Studio with SSIS and SSRS, and Tableau for data visualization. The dataset used for analysis is sourced from Kaggle, consisting of sales data with attributes such as customer details, product information, and sales metrics

QUESTION 1:

proof of concept data warehouse/mart (using dimensional model) capturing data
from an existing data source(s). Document your reasons for selecting the subject
area(s), identify key stakeholders, formalise the business vision for developing the
data warehouse from the given data source. Also explain the insights that a

QUESTION 4:
Produce four reports in support of the requirements outlined in section 1 using
SSRS. Also produce four visualisations using Tableau and discuss them. Develop a
dashboard in Tableau to show the visuals

QUESTION 5:
Multiple studies have been done comparing the performance of graph databases
and relational ones. Use a relational database such as Adventure Works (or you can
use any other relational database of your choice) as data source and implement a
graph database in Neo4J. Write any seven queries in SQL and CQL to use as
evidence to compare both databases and discuss the results to demonstrate the
differences of storing/retrieving data in/from relational and graph databases. Note:
These queries must provide useful information from the database
